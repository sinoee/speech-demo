SynthAndRecog
Synopsis
Plays a synthesized prompt and waits for speech to be recognized.

Syntax
SynthAndRecog(prompt, grammar, options)

Description
This application establishes two MRCP sessions: one for speech synthesis and the other for speech recognition. Once the user starts speaking (barge-in occurred), the synthesis session is stopped, and the recognition engine starts processing the input. Once recognition completes, the application exits and returns results to the Asterisk dialplan.

Input parameters
·         prompt [required]

A prompt specified as a plain text, an SSML content, or by means of a file or URI reference.

·         grammar [required]

An inline or URI grammar to be used for recognition.

·         options

Additional parameters such as an MRCP profile, synthesizer and recognizer header fields to be used.

p - profile to use in mrcp.conf

t - recognition timeout (msec)
