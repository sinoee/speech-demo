MRCPRecog
Synopsis
Performs MRCP recognition.

Syntax
MRCPRecog(grammar, options)

Description
This application establishes an MRCP session for speech recognition and optionally plays a prompt file to the user. Once recognition completes, the application exits and returns results to the Asterisk dialplan.

Input parameters
·         grammar [required]

An inline or URI grammar to be used for recognition.

·         options

Additional parameters such as an MRCP profile, recognizer header fields to be used.

p - profile to use in mrcp.conf

i - digits to allow recognition to be interrupted with (by default DTMFs are sent to the MRCP server to recognize; otherwise, if "any" or other digits are specified, recognition will be interrupted)

f - filename on play (if empty or not specified, no file is played)

t - recognition timeout (msec)

b - bargein value (no barge-in allowed=0, barge-in allowed=1)

gd – grammar delimiters

ct - confidence threshold (0.0 - 1.0)

sl - sensitivity level (0.0 - 1.0)

sva - speed vs accuracy (0.0 - 1.0)

nb - n-best list length

nit - no input timeout (msec)

sit - start input timers (true/false)

sct - speech complete timeout (msec)

sint - speech incomplete timeout (msec)

dit - DTMF interdigit timeout (msec)

dtt - DTMF terminate timout (msec)

dttc - DTMF terminate characters

sw - save waveform (true/false)

nac - new audio channel (true/false)

spl - speech language (en-US/en-GB/etc.)

rm - recognition mode (normal/hotword)

hmaxd - hotword max duration (msec)

hmind - hotword min duration (msec)

cdb - clear DTMF buffer (true/false)

enm - early no match (true/false)

iwu - input waveform URI

mt - media type

epe: exit on play error (1: terminate recognition on file play error, 0: continue even if file play fails)

uer: URI-encoded results (1: URI-encode NLMSL results, 0: do not encode)

Return parameters
·         RECOGSTATUS

If recognition completed, the variable ${RECOGSTATUS} is set to OK. Otherwise, if recognition could not be started, the variable ${RECOGSTATUS} is set to ERROR. If the caller hung up while recognition was still in-progress, the variable ${RECOGSTATUS} is set to INTERRUPTED.

·         RECOG_COMPLETION_CAUSE

The variable ${RECOG_COMPLETION_CAUSE} indicates whether recognition completed successfully with a match or an error occurred.

("000" - success, "001" - nomatch, "002" - noinput)

·         RECOG_RESULT

If recognition completed successfully, the variable ${RECOG_RESULT} is set to an NLSML result received from the MRCP server. Alternatively, the recognition result data can be retrieved by using the following dialplan functions RECOG_CONFIDENCE(), RECOG_GRAMMAR(), RECOG_INPUT(), and RECOG_INSTANCE().
